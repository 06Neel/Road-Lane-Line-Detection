# Road Lane Line Detection

Road Lane Line Detection is a computer vision project that aims to detect and track lane lines on the road. It is commonly used in autonomous vehicles, advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), and lane departure warning systems.

## Features

- **Image and Video Processing**: Implement algorithms to process images and video frames captured from a camera mounted on a vehicle.
- **Lane Line Detection**: Apply computer vision techniques to detect and extract lane lines from the processed images or video frames.
- **Line Tracking**: Track the detected lane lines across consecutive frames to estimate the vehicle's position within the lane.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the detected lane lines and tracking results on the original frames, providing a visual representation of the lane boundaries.

## Installation

To run the Road Lane Line Detection project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/06Neel/Road-Lane-Line-Detection.git`
2. Install any required dependencies or libraries specified in the project documentation.
3. Run the main script or application file to start the lane line detection process.
4. Provide input images or video frames to the program for lane line detection.
5. View the output frames with the detected lane lines and tracking results.

## Usage

1. Ensure that your input images or video frames contain clear and visible lane lines.
2. Run the program and provide the necessary input data, such as image or video file paths.
3. Wait for the program to process the frames and detect the lane lines.
4. View the output frames with the detected lane lines overlaid on the original images or video.
